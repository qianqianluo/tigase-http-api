== Scripting introduction

Scripts in the HTTP API component are used for processing all of requests.

To add a new action to the HTTP API component, you will need to create a script written in Groovy for which there will be implementation of class extending `tigase.http.rest.Handler` class.
The URI of script will be created from the file's location of in the scripts folder. For example, if script `TestHandler` with regular expression will be set to `/test` and will be placed in `scripts/rest/tested`, the handler will be called for using the following URI: `/rest/tested/test`.

=== Properties

If you are extending classes you will need to set following properties:

* *regex* - Regular expression which is used to match the request URI and parse parameters embedded in the URI. For example: `/\/([^@\/]+)@([^@\/]+)/`

* *requiredRole* - Required role of user in order to be able to access this URI. Available values are: null, "user", and "admin". If `requiredRole` is not null, authentication will be required.

* *isAsync* - If set to true, it will be possible to wait for results, for example waiting for an response IQ stanza.

=== Properties containing closures

Extended class should also set closures for one or more of following properties: execGet, execPut, execPost, and execDelete depending on which HTTP action or actions you need to support for the URI. *Each closure has a dynamic arguments list*. Below is list of arguments passed to closure which describes how and when the list of arguments changes:

. *service* - Implementation of Service interface. This is used to access the server database or send/receive XMPP stanzas.

. *callback* - The `callback` closure needs to be called to return data. `callback` accepts only one argument of type String,byte[],Map. If data is type of Map it will be encoded to JSON or XML depending of 'Content-Type' header.

. *user* - Will be passed only if `requiredRole` is not null. *In all other cases this argument will not be in arguments list!*

. *content* - Parsed content of request. This closure will not be in arguments list if Content-Length of request is empty. If Content-Type is XML or JSON returned as Map, otherwise it will be an instance of `HttpServletRequest`.

. *x* - Additional arguments passed to callback are groups from regular expression matching the URI. *Groups are not passed as a list, but are added to list of arguments as next arguments.*

If property for corresponding HTTP action is not set, then the component will return a 404 HTTP error.
